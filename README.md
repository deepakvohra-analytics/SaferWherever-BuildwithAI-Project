# SaferWherever-BuildwithAI-Project
BuildwithAI Global Hackathon Project Submission 
Doing my part to make our world #SaferWherever! I recently participated in the #buildwithai: Emergence! Global AI Hackathon. Our aim was to help our society emerge safer and stronger post-COVID-19 pandemic, using #AI and #DataScience.

Kudos to our awesome team Tugrul Guner Ignacio Amat PÃ©rez Dhruv Sheth Ramona R. Parijat Khan Arijit Das and special thanks to our mentor Harshit Saraswat.

Our project #SaferWherever is a real-time monitoring web application that uses CCTV videos as input for image detection and uses #machinelearning to compute and output metrics such as people density, face mask violations, temperature checks, and social distancing violations, with an objective to help the #retailindustry and other businesses monitor visitors in real-time and ensure compliance with safety guidelines.
